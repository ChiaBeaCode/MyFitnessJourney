## Your Fitness Journey
This repo is where I will be tracking my progress for my ongoing project "Your Fitness Journey".
This is a project I came to fruition when I was working out, and wanted to track the amount of reps I was doing. I knew I could simply download an app to do this for me, but what is the fun in that?

## Purpose
Your Fitness Journey is a program that will allow a user to catalog their exercise routine. It would include a counter, which would track the amount of reps for an exercise, which would be stored in a database. They would have the ability to review past workouts and their rep count. As I get further along, I hope to expand on the capabilty of this application to include further features.

## Project Goals:

### 1. User account
  - Allow user to either create an account (email, username, password) or OAuth with Github or Google
  - Each user would be able to store their exercises in a database for later viewing
### 2. Counter
  - Have the ability to track the amount of reps for a specfic exercise
  - Save rep count
### 3. Exercise Storage
  - Each exercise have their own card
  - Each card will contain their exercise name and date
  - The date section would hold the amount of reps completed for that exercise on said date
